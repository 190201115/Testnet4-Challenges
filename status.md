# Testnet 4 Status

## Rationale

The purpose of this document is to provide real-time information when it comes to the Concordium Test Network, including known issues, downtime and any specific event that could alter the participation in the program.

## Known issues, limitations and schedule events

### ✅ Test Network

* From 03-02-2021 to present, incident with sustained transaction loads reaching > 2000 TPS.
  * Regular transactions might not get included in blocks.
  * Nodes might experience performance issues or hard system crashes related to RAM exhaustion or exhausted disk space. 
  * Log size increases and might cause disk space issues.
  * Concordium nodes were restarted and finalization was consequently slowed down substantially.
* We are focusing on this issue, so we won’t be responding to individual support requests, questions or channel posts for the time being.
* We’d appreciate it very much, if you all kept the state of your node unchanged for now.
* More details will be published soon.

### ✅ Identity Issuer Notabene

  * No known issues

### ✅ Challenges & Supporting Tooling

* We will not reject submissions for the challenges, due to interruptions during the days 03/04/05-02-2021.
* We suggest to wait for our update before proceeding with the on-chain challenges OT4-B* and OT4-T*.
* The OT4-C* challenges can be completed.

## Past Updates

* [Feb 04 High Load Status Report](https://medium.com/concordium/ot4-high-load-status-report-6d4d5b441668) 
* [Jan 27 10:45 CET](https://discord.com/channels/667378330923696158/687313907500449849/803924019606716457) We are running some load experiments on the chain right now. Network delays and long finalization times as well as unresponsive network dashboards and wallets are to be expected.
